                                            First of, it's good to finally see someone who had the 
                                            same reason that I did for taking this class. Kristopher 
                                            and I both want another A in our transcipt.
                                        </p>

                                            The other things that the current CSCE 445 students 
                                            have in common with the '04 CSCS 445 students include 
                                            <span>phone usage</span>, <span>instant messaging</span>
                                            , <span>internet usage</span>, <span>email
                                            usage</span> , and even someone ahead of the game who 
                                            already started using <span>online music services.
                                            </span>
                                        </p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <div class="row h-100 align-items-center">
                                    <div class="col-12">

                                            Yes. Even though these were students 15 years ago, 
                                            people didn't necessarily change as much as devices. 
                                            Whether it is through watching televsion or listening 
                                            to music or talking to friends, people will always 
                                            seek sources of entertainment and socialization. This 
                                            is the same now, 15 years ago, or 50 years ago. Only 
                                            the medium of media changed. 
                                        </p>

                                </div>

                                            Boy, do we use a lot of different media usage compared 
                                            to students 15 years ago. Among these things include 
                                            <span>actual newspapers</span>, <span>landline 
                                                telephones</span>, <span>the radio</span>, 
                                                <span>mp3 players</span>, <span>car stereos</span>, 
                                                <span>old television shows</span>, and <span>paper 
                                                books</span>!
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Furthermore, just naming a few, they did not have 
                                            <span>Youtube</span>, <span>Netflix</span>, 
                                            <span>Spotify</span>, <span>Facebook</span>, 
                                            <span>Twitter</span>, <span>Instagram</span>, 
                                            <span>Snapchat</span>, and they actually studied 
                                            because they didn't have <span>Chegg</span>.
                                        </p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <div class="row h-100 align-items-center">
                                    <div class="col-12">
                                        <p>
                                            Now I'm not saying that we no longer watch television 
                                            or listen to the radio today, but these are by no means 
                                            the main medium in which we watch our shows or listen to 
                                            our music. However, devices such as the landline 
                                            telephone and mp3 players that were so popular back 
                                            then are rare gems nowadays. Although I am glad to 
                                            see that no one from '04 put walkman. They would be 
                                            calssified as '04's hipsters. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Such a drastic change even only from 15 years ago is 
                                            due to the advance in recent technologies. The devices 
                                            that we have today must accomodate for the trend of 
                                            rapid exchange of information. Many devices developed 
                                            today are made with the consideration of how it can 
                                            transfer data in the most efficient way. Changes in 
                                            the technology we had back then versus what we have 
                                            now may also be due to the convenience of 
                                            miniaturization and portability. Phones, laptops, 
                                            and telvisions are no longer seperate devices. This 
                                            leads to the obsoleteness of some devices, because 
                                            why have three different devices when you can have 
                                            one in your pocket? This also paved the way for 
                                            "smart" devices and the internet of things.
                                        </p>
