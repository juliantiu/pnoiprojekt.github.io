                                    <p>
                                        I am in this class, because I realized pretty late that I was a 
                                        visual learner. Additionally, not only was I a visual learner, 
                                        but also a kinesthetic one; so I thrive in visually interactive 
                                        environments. I mean, you guys have no idea how much time I spent 
                                        drawing Dijkstra's algorithm step by step, over and over again, 
                                        just to make it stick to my head. With the advent of technologies 
                                        such as interactive applications, websites, and even virtual 
                                        reality, I hope to work on products and applications in the future 
                                        that will help the young visual learners succeed in their 
                                        environment. Also, because my GPA needs a little help...
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>List of media I use in a weekly basis</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        High-level media? Let's see... hmm... as someone who's studying 
                                        computer science, I'm mostly in front of my computer screen. 
                                        If not, then probably on my phone. Regarding my phone, I use a lot 
                                        of instant messaging, audio calls, and video calls. Let's see, what 
                                        else? I do watch streams online. I also play a little bit of games 
                                        when I have the time (very little), but other than that, not really. 
                                        Oh, and yeah, I have an Amazon Alexa at home, but the only time I 
                                        really use it is when I tell it to snooze my alarm. Oh and one last 
                                        thing, I do spend a lot of time reading eBooks. I recently read "The 
                                        Five Dysfunctions of a Team" by Patrick Lencioni for CSCE 482. I 
                                        highly recommend it.

                                        Low-level media? uhh... let's start with what I'm on the 
                                        most, and that's going to have to be Youtube. When it comes 
                                        to other social media, I don't have any. Deleted them. I'm a 
                                        free man. When I stream online, it's usually on crunchyroll. 
                                        Pumped that Mob Pshyco 100 season 2 is out. Just waiting on 
                                        One Punch Man now. I also use GroupMe for my student 
                                        organization, Slack for my team projects, and a whole lot 
                                        of Gmail all day everyday.
